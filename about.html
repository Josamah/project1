            The internet enables people with personal computers to communicate and connect with each other. The internet has become the world’s largest place and shopping mall. It has information on almost everything in the world. Millions of people around the world are now online everyday exchanging messages, meeting and finding people free from unlimited time and distance. The internet can be used as a tool for war. No innovation in the world has grown so fast to touch many lives. The internet gives instant access to things happening everywhere.
            <P>
            <P>
            The internet is a key component of Americans culture and civilization.
            The idea of computer was by Dr Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider father of information theory who proposed the idea of how to deal with the problem of the socket switching. The socket switching was an era when people want to make call, they have to connect one person phone to another person phone over a socket.
            <P>
            <P>
            All the telephone line were located in one area. So, after the attacked by the Soviet Union all the lines were destroyed and Americans could not initiate a counter attack.
            With this they came up with ideas on how to invent technologies to fight wars. The military, Navy and AirForce came together and contracted universites to research into new areas of fighting war.
            <P>
            <P>
            They formed what is called the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which later became Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in February 7, 1998.
            Paul Baran was hired to put a system in place to help deal with the situation. Baran designed packet that is putting message into pieces.
            By 1962, there was enough research and theory to show that a variable computer network could be built but implementing one has to wait seven years until 1969 coincidentally the same year man walked on the moon.
            The first computer network was by a scientist called Robert Bob Tailor.
            <P>
            <P>
            The early 1960, mails were only delivered by post office. In the world of computers, the new idea was system called Time Sharing.
            In 1966 Bob Tailor needed a separate terminal to log into each time-sharing computer at a research center across the country. No two computers could talk to each other.
            Tailor employed Dr Lawrence Robert to build a connection between two computers.
            <P>
            <P>
            In 1968 Lawrence Robert sought engineers to build the ARPNET. It was based on the interface message processor (packet switching). A group of people called the BBN won the contract and build the first ARPANET in 1961. The BBN faced numerous challenges like how to stop the packet from circulating forever, where to find a problem with computes and fixed them.
            On September 1,1969, the first piece of hardware created for the computer network for full running of the internet came at UCLA. By the end of 1969, all face were interconnected.
            In April 1971, ARPANET has 18 mainframe computers put into the network. Robert Metcalfe connected MIT together.
            The ARPANET had little to do but with the invention of emails by Raymond Tomlinson made it busy.
            <P>
            <P>
          In October 1972, ARPA turned science fiction into science facts. By 19972 ARPA has fueled 25 sites online. Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) emerged later.
            In 1973, Bob Khan came out with the TCP/IP Protocol that enable the internet to interconnect.
            In 1983, TCP/IP was adopted as the international standards marked a milestone in the network development. Private networks like American online started springing up.
            Congress passed a bill to take the internet from the government to the public. In June 9,1992, the president signed into law.
            Tim Barnes Lee made http in a browser. That is the world Wide Web (WWW) in 1989.
            <P>
            <P>
            The age of the web browser began with various struggle to decide on how to control the future of the just emerging world. The struggle that ended with an epic court room battle and that will be forever remembered as the Browser war.
            <P>
            <P>
            The amazing tale of how the internet took the world began with an over imagination of a group of panelists mainly gulf lovers and a graduate of computer science from the university who lived in a strange new world and explored space, a place called cyber space.
            <P>
            <P>
            Back in 1993, these guys were fascinated by obscure scientific network called the world wide web, invented in 1989 by an English scientist called Tim Barnes Lee. WWW was one of the technologies you don’t know you it until you start using it.
            <P>
            <P>
            Back then the web was very different. There were few web pages and consisted of nothing but line after line and a boring text. It was hardly anything worth fining and no way to find it anywhere. There had to be a big time Gig to get excited about these things.
            <P>
            <P>
            In the fall of 1993, the owner of Gig posted mosaic online and made it a freely downloadable gift to humanity.
            Before Mosaic could go truly global and empower Bill Gate and Microsoft, it needed one more ingredient a giant keeping parallel pash.
            A poor kid from west Texas a high school dropout who turned himself into a computer science professor at Stanford then found a company called Silicon Graphics then found Mosaic. They planned on how to turn mosaic into a business venture.
            <P>
            <P>
            Bill gate was the co-founder and CEO of Microsoft, the most important, fantastic and profitable high-tech company of the world. For two decades Microsoft has established a new Minneapolis of PC operating systems.
            <P>
            <P>
            Bill Gate started the information highway to be a toll road from which Microsoft control all the tollbooths and we all have to pay and drive.
            Bill Gate turned to became a powerful figure in technology in 1975 when at the age of 19 he dropped out of college and started   Microsoft with his friend called Paul Allen.
            Bill Gate dream was that every computer was using Microsoft and by 1983, his dream was becoming a reality. About 90% of the world PC were using Microsoft windows.
            <P>
            <P>
            In December 1994, network communication was launch by Tim Clark. They were determined to reach beyond all boundaries. They first have to deal with a sever carriage shocks.
            On the 13th of October, 1994, Net Gig (Space Navigator) browser finally hit the streets to take Microsoft of the market.
            On December 7, 1995, Gate let the world known that he had Netscape in his site. Microsoft planned to send Netscape to his early grave with a net browser called the windows explorer. Microsoft gave out the windows explorer for free in order to kick Netscape out of the market.
            By September 1997, the browser war was over. Microsoft has moved triumphant a head of Netscape.
            <P>
            <P>
            There was a law suit against Microsoft in1998 by the government accusing Microsoft of using his windows Minneapolis to engage in a wide variety of business practices to prevent consumers from accessing Netscape products.

            The was a problem with the world wide web when you are not able to navigate your way around.
            Electrical engineering students Jerry Yang and David Filo (founders of Yahoo.com) began the search to find a way to win the fantasy basketball league. This led to the invention of the Yahoo browser but they needed money to build it. They were scared to put an advert on the net.
            <P>
            <P>
            Late 1995, Yahoo began to put the burner arts and hold their breathe and crossed their figures. A lot people started putting up adverting on yahoo.
            By 1996, yahoo faced some challenges they were gaining grounds on it.
            Yahoo had a formidable rival called Excited, a search tool founder by Joe Krans, Co-founder, Excite.
            <P>
            <P>
            By 1997, the internet was exploding. Millions of people fluent online to see what the excitement was about. The search company stop caring about search. You try searching something and you find nothing.
            Google came into existence in September 1998.
            Bill Gross, Founder of Idelab provided google with it salvation. Back of the late 1990 was an exception of web advertising. Keywords was laudable to search engine.
            In 1998, Bill launched the site base on keywords response links that was eventually called Overture.
            <P>
            <P>
            Google saw Gross idea as a solution to his business. The google boys met Gross to find a head way to put things together. Google came out a search engine that looked like the overture. Gross then sued google for similarities.
            On August 19,2004, google went public listing a share for sale on the NASDAQ stock market.
            <P>
            <P>
            Jeff Bezos started a market place on the internet (Amazon.com). he launched amazon somewhere 1995.
            Around that same time from Silicon Valley another young guy called Pierre Omidyar, a software developer also thought of how to use the internet to make money.
            He came out a company called eBay in September 1995. People began the use the internet as fast as possible.
            <P>
            <P>
            After the invention of radio, it took 38 years before 50 million people were using it, with television it took 13 years but once the internet was opened to the general public it took 4 years before 50 million people using it. This was an explosive growth.
            <P>
            <P>
            The spread of microprocessors among others doubled very 18 months. This was one half of the technology war. The other half of the war was the Medscape Law, coined by Robert Medscape and Bernard. Every new node meaning-like computer which is added to the network, does not keep the network plus one but the curve was stepper and stepper.
            <P>
            <P>
            By the middle of 1999, moons law and Medscape law were working hand in hand, faster and cheaper computers were increasingly connected together making the network more useful.
            The Amazon IPO got place in may 1997. The company was two years old. Get big fast was amazon strategy.
            eBay was scheduled to launch it public offering in September 1998.
            <P>
            <P>
            By 1999 it was clear that the 90s has become the E- decade.  Everyday sees e-commerce came into existence. A lot of e-commerce.com started coming up. Fiber used curves lines to send information.
            In 1999, the total number of IBO or IPO was 250 but eBay and amazon took over more of the other Dot.com companies.
            After September 11, most of the e- commerce dropped death. They blamed it on wall Street. 5 years later the billionaires of the Dot.com has gone down but amazon and eBay were able to survive the tragedy. A lot of companies came up after the tragedy.

            From the Silicon Valley, California, Chad Hurley, Kelvin Rose and Jay Adelson were among the web 2.0 evolution. Rose and Adelson ran the Digg (social news website). Chad Hurley was a co-founder of YouTube.
            Mark Zuckerberg was the founder and CEO of Facebook.
            David Weekly was the pioneer of mp3 and put music together on pcs and the web.
            Shawn Fanning founder, Napster put music together on the web that could be downloaded on people’s pc by signing up to Napster.
            In 1999, Fanning came out with the code for napster. Napster became one of the widely spread used tool to download music. Napster was shut down completely after a lot of file suit against him for copyrights and allowing people downloaded music for free.
